      "Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is widely used for building applications and software across various platforms. It was originally developed by Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by Oracle Corporation. Java is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible, making it a popular choice for developers due to its portability across platformsâ€”commonly referred to as \"write once, run anywhere\" (WORA).\n",
      "\n",
      "Key features of Java include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Platform Independence**: Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can be run on any device equipped with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), regardless of the underlying computer architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Java follows the principles of OOP, which helps in organizing complex programs into manageable, modular components.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Automatic Memory Management**: Java includes garbage collection, which automatically manages memory allocation and deallocates objects that are no longer in use, helping to prevent memory leaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Robustness and Security**: Java provides strong memory management, exception handling, and a range of security features that help protect applications from vulnerabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Rich Standard Library**: Java boasts a comprehensive standard library that provides pre-built functions and utilities, facilitating rapid development.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Concurrency**: Java has built-in support for multithreading, allowing developers to write programs that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Distributed Computing**: Java has capabilities for developing distributed systems, including support for remote method invocation (RMI) and CORBA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Java is used in a wide range of applications, from mobile applications (especially Android apps) to large-scale enterprise systems, web applications, and scientific computing. Its versatility, community support, and ongoing development make it a staple in the programming world.\n"

It provides tools for debugging, monitoring, and evaluating applications that use natural language processing (NLP) models, making it easier to create reliable and effective language-based applications. LangSmith integrates with LangChain, a popular framework for developing applications with large language models (LLMs), to offer seamless support throughout the development lifecycle.\n"

       "'Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are designed to operate with a degree of autonomy, making decisions and taking actions with minimal human intervention. These systems possess \"agency,\" which means they can perceive their environment, reason about potential actions, and execute tasks to achieve specific goals. Agentic AI often incorporates elements of machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics to enhance its decision-making capabilities and adaptability to changing environments.\\n\\nThe concept of Agentic AI is particularly relevant in applications such as autonomous vehicles, personal assistants, and industrial automation, where AI systems need to operate independently and respond dynamically to new situations. However, with this level of autonomy comes the need for robust ethical considerations and safety measures to ensure that these AI systems act in ways that are aligned with human values and safety standards.'"
